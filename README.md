# AWS Cloud Formation Template - Malware Analysis
This template is designed to spin up a temporary malware analysis platform and all its required resources in AWS. Once the environment has been created by Cloudformation, the new system will pull over a powershell script and install all required software. 

## Requirements
AWS administrator must have a valid Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) created. Make sure that you note the VPC ID (ex: vpc-12345678) and subnet.

## Template Details
This template uses the latest `Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base` for your respective region. This stack will create:
- EC2 Instance
- Subnet
- Security Group

## Creating a Stack
1. Navagate to the AWS CloudFormation site.
2. Choose **Upload a template to Amazon S3** and choose **malware-re.yaml**.
3. Click Next.
4. Fill in a unique name for `Stack name`.
5. Set the password and username for `AdminPassword` and `AdminUser` respectively.
6. Choose the `InstanceType` based on your requirements. Note that you will be charged for larger deployments.
7. Choose the `KeyName` you wish to use for this deployment.
8. Leave the value in `LatestAmiId`.
9. Enter a network CIDR block that fits within the CIDR block of your VPC. For example, a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.10.0.0/16; a CIDR block for this entry could be 10.10.1.0/24.
10. If you would like to restrict the ingress into this system to a network or specific IP address, enter it here. For example, if my public IP address was 12.34.56.78, this entry would be **12.34.56.78/32**.
11. Enter your VPC ID for `VPC`.
12. Click Next, Next, then Create

Ensure that you monitor the `Events` tab for any errors in deployment.
